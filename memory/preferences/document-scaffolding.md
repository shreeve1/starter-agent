title: Documents Go in Folders, Never the Root
summary: No loose files in the workspace root - folder map, naming, what git tracks vs ignores, formats; ask before new top-level folders.

## Active memory

- The user does not want loose documents in the workspace root. Any report, document, Markdown, HTML, CSV, spreadsheet, or diagram is saved inside a folder; create the folder first if it is missing.
- Folder map (choose by what the file is):
  - `reports/`: finished reports and analyses, `<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
  - `research/`: research notes and investigations, `<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
  - `notes/`: quick personal notes, scratch lists and pending proposals.
  - `tasks/`: saved work in progress, `index.md` for active/waiting work, `archive/` for closed records.
  - `projects/<short>/`: independent project work, starting with `README.md` (Project README format in `.agents/skills/personal-memory/supporting-templates.md`). It links the goal, scope, completion check, tasks, files and authoritative memory. Create only useful subfolders; setup may choose `research`, `design` and `procedures`, never ticket folders by default.
  - `clients/<short>/`: client documents when client work applies; `client_dirs` in `memory/schema.json` lists their document folders. Client-owned projects can stay under `clients/<short>/projects/`.
  - `<client_folder>/<short>/`: when the owner tracks projects, devices or another kind of thing, setup replaces the client entry with that home and chooses suitable `client_dirs`. If the folder is `projects`, use the project entry above, not a duplicate or nested `projects/` default. With clients plus independent projects, keep both distinct homes.
  - `artifacts/<topic>/`: generated working files (diagrams, spreadsheets, drafts). The default when nothing else fits.
  - `tmp/`: throwaway files, deletable any time.
  - `.handoff/`, `youtube/`: owned by their skills; nothing else goes there.
- For project work, open the relevant README before acting; follow its task and memory links. A project groups related work, `tasks/` tracks individual saved work, and `memory/` holds lasting knowledge and approved agent procedures. Project runbooks stay documents, not execution authority.
- Precedence: a path the user names wins, then a skill's own output path, then this map.
- Naming: lowercase, hyphenated, date last as `YYYY-MM-DD`. A task producing several files groups them in one `<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD/` subfolder.
- Git: `memory/`, `tasks/`, `projects/`, selected tracked-thing documents, `research/`, `notes/` and `reports/` are tracked; binaries, raw transcripts, `artifacts/` and `tmp/` are ignored. Check with `git check-ignore -v <path>`. Credentials go nowhere; keep only references to where they live.
- Formats: Markdown for notes, plans, runbooks, handoffs and decisions; CSV for simple tables; Excel only when asked or formatting matters; PowerPoint only for requested slides; HTML previews as `index.html` inside their folder or a `http://localhost:<port>` URL.
- A new top-level folder only when nothing fits, proposed first with its name.
- Loose root files found by an agent are left in place, reported with a proposed home, and moved only when the user says so.
- After creating or updating a document, name its workspace-relative path in the final answer.
